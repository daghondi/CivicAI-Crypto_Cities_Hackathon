# CivicAI: Smart Proposal Engine for Island Governance
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Project Overview
CivicAI is a revolutionary web-based civic engagement platform designed to transform how citizens participate in local governance. The system leverages artificial intelligence to convert real-world urban problems into structured, actionable proposals that can be voted on through blockchain-based governance mechanisms. Initially focused on island communities like RoatÃ¡n/PrÃ³spera, CivicAI creates a bridge between citizen concerns and governmental action through an intuitive, transparent, and democratically-driven interface.

The platform addresses the critical gap in civic participation by making it easier for citizens to not only voice their concerns but to see those concerns transformed into concrete proposals with clear implementation pathways, cost estimates, and impact assessments.

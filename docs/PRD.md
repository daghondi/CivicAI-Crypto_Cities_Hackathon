# CivicAI: Advanced Web3 Governance Platform for Crypto Cities
## Product Requirements Document (PRD) - v2.0

### Project Overview
CivicAI is a revolutionary Web3-native civic engagement platform that transforms citizen participation in local governance through AI-powered proposal generation and cryptographically-verified voting systems. Built specifically for crypto cities and island communities like Roatán/Próspera, CivicAI creates a seamless bridge between citizen concerns and governmental action through an intuitive, transparent, and democratically-driven interface.

The platform leverages advanced AI for intelligent proposal generation, implements cryptographic voting with one-vote-per-wallet enforcement, and provides comprehensive governance analytics. By combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, CivicAI ensures transparent, tamper-proof civic participation while maintaining user privacy and data sovereignty.
